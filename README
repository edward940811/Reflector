makefile:
 python enables to execute by adding the python environment in the script
 so the makefile is simply /cp [source] reflector

reflector.py:
  for the input, using argparse to make sure all the inputs are correct
  then defining a reflectorcallback() for the sniff function
  and a secondphasepackage() for altering the package information

  reflectorcallback:
    by reading elements in the package
      if ARP:
        create a arpreply that contains op=2 and target address

      if IP:
        we look at the dst of the package first, for the first phase
        which is the request by attacker, we give back the reflector_ip
        for the second phase, which is the reply of the attacker,
        we give him the packet of himself by changing the ip to the victim
        to fool him
